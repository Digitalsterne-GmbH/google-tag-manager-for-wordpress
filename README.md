# Google Tag Manager for Wordpress
 Simple, secure and fast integration of Googe Tag Manager with minimal impact on performance

## Why to use our plugin and not one of the existing out there?

There are a lot of good plugins out there that do an excellent job of integrating the Google Tag Manager. Unfortunately we have not yet found a plugin that simply integrates the container without a lot of "bells and whistles".

Every other registered plugin in Wordpress is a potential performance problem. For this reason we do without a lot of functions and offer the only important function with our plugin: A simple, secure and reliable integration of the Google Tag Manager without impairing the performance of Wordpress by an extensive and complex plugin.
