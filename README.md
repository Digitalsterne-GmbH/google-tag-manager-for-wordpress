# Google Tag Manager for Wordpress
 Simple, secure and fast integration of Googe Tag Manager with minimal impact on performance

## Why to use our plugin and not one of the existing out there?

There are a lot of good plugins out there that do an excellent job of integrating the Google Tag Manager. Unfortunately we have not yet found a plugin that simply integrates the container without a lot of "bells and whistles".

Every other registered plugin in Wordpress is a potential performance problem. For this reason we do without a lot of functions and offer the only important function with our plugin: A simple, secure and reliable integration of the Google Tag Manager without impairing the performance of Wordpress by an extensive and complex plugin.

## Installation

- Wordpress Plugin Manager
- Download from Github
- Download from Wordpress Plugin Directory (https://wordpress.org/plugins/digitalsterne-tag-manager/)

Don't forget to activate the plugin after installation completed.

## Configuration

The configuration of our plugin is as simple as the installation. Visit the following page in your Wordpress Admin Panel...

Settings > General

... and scroll down. Here you can find a new field "Google Tag Manager ID" where you can put your Container ID.
